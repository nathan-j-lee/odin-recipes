    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of my goto meals from a heavy workout or just a quick meal on the go!</p>
    <p>Very quick to make as most of the prep work is from buying the powder.</p>
    <p>You can also add whatever ingredient you want into the shake for a better taste&sol;texture</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Protein Powder of your choice (I would recommend a vanilla or chocolate flavor as they are the most common)</li>
        <li>Water (or some kind of milk for texture)</li>
        <li>Any fruit you would like (or none to keep it simple)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add liquid of your choice to blender or shaker cup</li>
        <li>Add a scoop of protein powder to blender or shaker cup</li>
        <li>Optional: <strong>(If you are using a blender)</strong> Add fruits to blender</li>
        <li>Run blender until smooth or shake cup until smooth</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
