    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An Asian classic dish made with (hopefully) leftover rice from a previous meal.</p>
        <p>My mom always made it ever since I was very young and cannot enjoy any other fried rice as much as hers.</p>
        <p>It may not be the prettiest meal, but it always has a special place in my heart.</p>
